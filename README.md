## What is QuRTIDO?

QuRTIDO is a collection of open standardized datasets for benchmarking numerical and machine learning techniques for <strong style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: normal;">Qu</strong>antum state <strong style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: normal;">R</strong>econstruction, <strong style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: normal;">T</strong>omography, and <strong style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: normal;">I</strong>nference on various quantum and condensed matter systems. We</strong> created this dataset in an effort to provide researchers in physics and machine learning with easily accessible data to benchmark their network architectures. 

*Curtido is a relish made from a usually made from a collection of vegetables such as cabbage, onion, carrots, typically served as a side with pupusas, the national delicacy of Salvador.*

## Datasets

At present, this collection contains data for the following models:

* 2D Ising model spin configurations
* Z2 2D Ising Gauge theory bond configurations
* 1D Ising model with transverse field spin configurations
* 2D Classical XY model (the $O(2)$ rotor model) 
* 2D Spin 1/2 Quantum Heisenberg Model

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this dataset is to collect datasets that are interesting to study for the advancement of machine learning techniques but are also physically relevant models that can provide insight to our theoretic understanding of condensed matter models. 

Some of these datasets are straightforward, others are more computationally intensive to generate. The computational methods involved in generating many of the datasets are non-trivial, and providing a high-quality, complete dataset saves time for researchers trying to get a start in the field. 

## Contributing

We are always open to suggestions as well as collaborations. We would also be happy to accept datasets to be included in QuRTIDO.
